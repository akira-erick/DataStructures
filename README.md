# C++ Data Structures Project
## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive collection of essential data structures implemented in C++. Each data structure is written with reusability, modularity, and performance in mind, demonstrating core concepts like memory management, efficiency, and C++ features (e.g., templates, classes, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading).

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each data structure is implemented in separate files to ensure modularity and resability
- **Template-based** Where applicable, generic data structures use C++ templates, allowing them to wotk with any data type

## Data Structures Implemented

1. __**Array**__
    - **Header**: `Array.h`
    - **Description**: A dynamic array implemented using templates, allowing it to store data of any type. This array is used to store data, and it's not mutable.
        - `**getArray()**`: Returns a copy of the array.
        - `**get(int index)**`: Returns the value at the specified index.
        - `**print()**`: Outputs the entire array.
        - `**operator=()**`: Overloaded assignment operator for deep copy
